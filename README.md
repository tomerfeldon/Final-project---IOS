# 🏃 RunTracker

*[עברית](README.he.md)*

A running tracker for iOS. Start a run and watch your time and distance climb
live from GPS, save it when you are done, and browse every run you have logged.

Built with **UIKit + Storyboard**, **Swift**, targeting **iOS 15+**, and backed
by **two Firebase databases** — Cloud Firestore for permanent run history and
the Realtime Database for the live, in-progress session.

> [!NOTE]
> This is an iOS course final project. The scope is deliberately focused: a
> clean, working implementation of a real feature set rather than a large app.

## Features

- **Live run tracking** — elapsed time updated every second by a `Timer`, and
  cumulative distance computed from GPS with jitter and teleport filtering.
- **Start / Pause / Stop** — pause and resume freely; Stop asks before saving.
- **Permanent history** — every finished run is stored in Firestore and shown in
  a table with a custom cell (date, distance, duration, average pace).
- **Live listener** — the list updates itself the instant a run is saved,
  deleted, or edited, with no manual refresh.
- **Run details** — a full breakdown per run, a map with start/finish pins, and
  an editable free-text note saved back to Firestore.
- **Resume a run** — if the app is closed mid-run, it offers to pick the run
  back up on next launch, restored from the Realtime Database.
- **Light / Dark toggle** — a one-tap switch in the navigation bar, remembered
  between launches, on top of full system-appearance support.
- **Rotation** — every screen lays out correctly in portrait and landscape via
  Auto Layout and stack views.

## Screens

| Screen | What it does |
|---|---|
| **My Runs** (`RunsListController`) | The run history, newest first. Tap a run for details, swipe to delete, or tap **New Run**. A sun/moon button toggles light/dark. |
| **Active Run** (`ActiveRunController`) | Live time, distance, and pace. Start / Pause / Stop. Writes the live session to the Realtime Database every second. |
| **Run Details** (`RunDetailController`) | All stats for one run, a map of the route endpoints, and an editable note. |

## Tech stack

- **Language:** Swift
- **UI:** UIKit + Storyboard, Auto Layout (stack-view based)
- **Location:** Core Location (`CLLocationManager`)
- **Maps:** MapKit (`MKMapView`)
- **Backend:** Firebase — `FirebaseCore`, `FirebaseFirestore`, `FirebaseDatabase`
- **Dependencies:** Swift Package Manager
- **Minimum iOS:** 15.0

```

The three `Services/` classes keep each controller focused: the controller owns
its screen, the service owns one database or sensor. Communication between the
custom cell and its controller uses the delegate/protocol pattern
(`RunCellDelegate`).

## Getting started

You need a **Mac with Xcode**. The steps below have a hard ordering — read the
callouts.

### Prerequisites

- Xcode 15 or newer (see the Firebase version note below for Xcode 16.2)
- A free [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com) project

### 1. Firebase console

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Create **both** databases **before** you register the iOS app. The
> `DATABASE_URL` key is only written into `GoogleService-Info.plist` if the
> Realtime Database already exists — otherwise the app fails at runtime in a way
> that looks like a code bug.

1. **Add project** → name it `RunTracker` (Google Analytics not needed).
2. **Build → Firestore Database → Create database** → **test mode** → pick a region.
3. **Build → Realtime Database → Create database** → **test mode**.
4. **Add app → iOS**, bundle ID `com.tomer.RunTracker`, download
   `GoogleService-Info.plist`.

> [!NOTE]
> Test mode leaves both databases open and its rules expire after 30 days. That
> is fine for coursework — if reads start failing weeks later, this is why.

### 2. Xcode project

1. **File → New → Project → iOS → App.** Product Name `RunTracker`, Interface
   **Storyboard**, Language **Swift**, bundle ID `com.tomer.RunTracker`. Set the
   deployment target to **iOS 15.0**.
2. **Delete the template files first** — this repo ships its own. Select and
   **Move to Trash**: `AppDelegate.swift`, `SceneDelegate.swift`,
   `ViewController.swift`, `Main.storyboard`, `LaunchScreen.storyboard`,
   `Assets.xcassets`. Leaving them causes `invalid redeclaration` errors.
3. Add this repo's source. Drag `Model`, `Services`, `Controllers`, `Views`,
   `Extensions`, `Assets.xcassets`, and `AppDelegate.swift` / `SceneDelegate.swift`
   into the empty `RunTracker` group (*Copy items if needed*, *Create groups*,
   target checked).

   > [!WARNING]
   > Add the two storyboards as **individual files**, not by dragging the whole
   > `Base.lproj` folder. A new project already has a `Base.lproj`, and dragging
   > another one in creates a stray `Base 2.lproj` that the app cannot find —
   > you will get a runtime crash `Could not find a storyboard named 'Main'`.
   > Drag `Main.storyboard` and `LaunchScreen.storyboard` in on their own.

4. Drag your real `GoogleService-Info.plist` in (target checked). Do **not**
   rename `GoogleService-Info.SAMPLE.plist` — it is a reference only.
5. **File → Add Package Dependencies** → `https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk`.
   Add exactly `FirebaseCore`, `FirebaseFirestore`, `FirebaseDatabase`.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > **On Xcode 16.2 or older,** Firebase 12.15+ requires a newer toolchain and
   > will fail to resolve. In the Add Package dialog set the Dependency Rule to
   > **Up to Next Major Version** from **11.0.0** to pull a Firebase 11.x
   > release. The APIs used here are identical. When picking products, set every
   > product except the three above to **None** (the list scrolls — the three
   > are below the `FirebaseAnalytics*` entries).

6. **Target → Info** → add **Privacy - Location When In Use Usage Description**
   (`NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription`) with a value such as
   `RunTracker uses your location to measure the distance of your runs.` Without
   it, iOS silently refuses the permission prompt.
7. **Target → General → Device Orientation:** enable Portrait, Landscape Left,
   and Landscape Right.
8. **Build and run.**

> [!TIP]
> The simulator's GPS is synthetic. To make distance move, choose
> **Features → Location → City Run** in the simulator, then press Start.

## How it works: two databases, on purpose

The point of the project is using each database for what it is good at.

**Cloud Firestore** — permanent, queryable run history:

```
runs/
  <auto-id>/
    date, distanceMeters, durationSeconds, averagePaceSecPerKm,
    startLat, startLng, endLat, endLng, note
```

Read with `addSnapshotListener`, so the list re-renders the moment anything
changes — no manual refresh, one source of truth.

**Realtime Database** — the live session only, while a run is in progress:

```
activeRun/
  isActive, elapsedSeconds, distanceMeters, startTimestamp
```

Overwritten every second during a run and removed with `removeValue()` when it
ends. On launch, if `isActive` is `true`, the app offers to resume.

> A small, hot, throwaway value written many times a second is exactly what the
> Realtime Database is built for; durable records you keep and query are what
> Firestore is built for. That is why both are here.

Two implementation details worth calling out:

- **The clock is derived from dates, not counted.** `Timer` makes no real-time
  guarantees, so elapsed time is computed as `Date().timeIntervalSince(start)` on
  each tick. The timer only triggers a refresh; it is never the source of truth.
- **GPS is filtered.** Fixes that are inaccurate, stale, or imply an
  implausible speed (a signal glitch or a simulator teleport) are rejected, so
  standing still does not invent distance and a jump does not add kilometres.

## Course requirements

| Requirement | Where |
|---|---|
| Table View + custom cell | `RunsListController`, `Views/RunCell.swift` |
| Firestore | `Services/RunStore.swift` |
| Realtime Database | `Services/ActiveRunStore.swift` |
| Location | `Services/RunLocationTracker.swift` |
| Timers | `ActiveRunController` |
| Dark Mode | Semantic colors + `AccentGreen` color set + manual toggle (`AppTheme`) |
| Screen rotation | Auto Layout + stack views; the active-run stats reflow in landscape |
| Delegate pattern | `RunCellDelegate` between the cell and its controller |

## Known limitations

- **No background location.** The app requests "when in use" only, so tracking
  pauses if you leave it mid-run. Continuous tracking would need the Background
  Modes capability and an "always" prompt, beyond this project's scope.
- **No authentication.** All runs share one collection. Firebase Auth and
  per-user scoping would be the natural next step.
- **Simulator GPS is synthetic.** Real accuracy needs a physical device.
